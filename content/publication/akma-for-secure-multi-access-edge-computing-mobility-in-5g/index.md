abstract: Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) extends the cloud computing
  capabilities to the edge of the 5G network. The current 3rd Generation
  Partnership Project (3GPP) and European Telecommunications Standard Institute
  (ETSI) specifications about MEC cover connectivity between a mobile user and a
  MEC host, including security, but they do not extend to application-level
  security and privacy issues. We solve the problem of creating a secure and
  privacy-preserving communication channel between a mobile user and a
  distributed MEC application. The solution is limited to the case where the
  mobile network remains the same during communication. The solution is based on
  the 3GPP AKMA for authentication and key sharing. It includes protocols for
  (1) registering the user to the main server of the application, (2) updating
  the user information and shared keys with the main server of the application,
  (3) using the application in the MEC host in the static case, (4) using the
  application in MEC host while moving.
