abstract: Multi-SIM User Equipment (UE) can have more than one physical slot for Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). The eUICC is an embedded version of the UICC, which cannot be physically removed from the communication device. Currently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is working on developing Authentication and Key Management for Applications (AKMA), with which users can bootstrap authentication towards the application server from their mobile subscription. We consider the scenario that may become common in devices with Multi-SIM and eUICC, in which one subscription is used for primary services such as voice and data, and another subscription is used for AKMA services. In this scenario, the purpose is to use AKMA services simultaneously and without interrupting primary services. There are existing requirements for Multi-SIM and eUICC, which restrain this scenario from being successful. The solution that we propose includes arrangements and adaptations, in order to provide secure and uninterrupted services of both primary and AKMA services.
