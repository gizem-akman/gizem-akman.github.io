abstract: Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) is one of the emerging key
  technologies in Fifth Generation (5G) Mobile Networks, providing reduced
  end-to-end latency for applications and reduced load in the transport network.
  This paper is about user privacy in MEC within 5G. We consider a basic MEC
  usage scenario, where the user accesses an application hosted in the MEC
  platform via the radio access network of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO).
  First, we create a system model based on this scenario, then define the
  adversary model and privacy requirements for this system model. Second, we
  introduce a privacy-preserving access solution for the system model and
  analyze the solution against the privacy requirements.
